## Should `wasm-opt` be used to further optimize the wasm binary generated after
## the Rust compiler has finished? Using `wasm-opt` can often further decrease
## binary size or do clever tricks that haven't made their way into LLVM yet.
##
## Configuration is set to `false` by default for the dev profile, but it can
## be set to an array of strings which are explicit arguments to pass to
## `wasm-opt`. For example `['-Os']` would optimize for size while `['-O4']`
## would execute very expensive optimizations passes
##
## In most cases, the `-O[X]` flag is enough. However, if you require extreme
## optimizations, see the full list of `wasm-opt` optimization flags
